" Sometimes syntax highlighting can get out of sync in large JSX and TSX files. 
" This was happening too often for me so I opted to enable syntax sync fromstart, 
" which forces vim to rescan the entire buffer when highlighting. 
" This does so at a performance cost, especially for large files. 
" Enable this when I enter a JavaScript or TypeScript buffer, and disable it when I leave:
autocmd BufEnter *.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} :syntax sync fromstart
autocmd BufLeave *.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} :syntax sync clear
